# Tabular Question Answering Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Tabular-data Question Answering (tabular QA) system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) technology.
The goal is to provide an intuitive and accessible system for extracting information from tabular data through natural language queries.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- **`eval_bert.py`**: Python script for evaluating the performance of the `bert-base-uncased` model on tabular question answering. 
- **`eval_gpt2.py`**: Python script for evaluating the performance of the `gpt2` model on tabular question answering.
